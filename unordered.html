      <p>
        Metropolitan France, often called Mainland France, lies in Western
        Europe and covers a total area of approximately 543,940 km2 (210,020
        mi2). To the northeast, it borders Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany,
        Switzerland, and Italy lie to the east, while to the southeast, Monaco
        and the Mediterranean Sea frame its contours. Spain rests to the
        southwest, and Andorra tucks between them. The Bay of Biscay flanks its
        western edge, and the English Channel, which separates it from the
        United Kingdom, defines its northwestern coastline; both the channel and
        the bay are extensions of the Atlantic Ocean.

        facts & stats → One of Europe’s largest countries, Germany encompasses a
        wide variety of landscapes: the tall, sheer mountains of the south; the
        sandy, rolling plains of the north; the forested hills of the urbanized
        west; and the plains of the agricultural east. At the spiritual heart of
        the country is the magnificent east-central city of Berlin, which rose
        phoenixlike from the ashes of World War II and now, after decades of
        partition, is the capital of a reunified Germany, and the Rhine River,
        which flows northward from Switzerland and is celebrated in visual art,
        literature, folklore, and song.

        Outside the British Isles, England is often erroneously considered synonymous with the island of Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and even with the entire United Kingdom. Despite the political, economic, and cultural legacy that has secured the perpetuation of its name, England no longer officially exists as a governmental or political unit—unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which all have varying degrees of self-government in domestic affairs. It is rare for institutions to operate for England alone. Notable exceptions are the Church of England (Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, have separate branches of the Anglican Communion) and sports associations for cricket, rugby, and football (soccer). In many ways England has seemingly been absorbed within the larger mass of Great Britain since the Act of Union of 1707.</p>
